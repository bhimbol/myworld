        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, I'm Mark Lister Espelimbergo Abria. This is my web profile page.
            I'm just starting to learn web development using Python and Django.
            I would like to improve my programming skills using this platform as a practice tool.
            I graduated as a Computer Engineer, and I'm passionate about programming.
            However, I have not been able to secure a job in a reputable IT company.
            My career is currently not aligned with my educational background,
            but I am still actively developing my knowledge in this field.
        </p>

                    <p>
                       I have developed an App Script for Google called 'ASN Sender' to streamline my work tasks.
                       In my current job, we previously had to manually download emails with attachments, which was time-consuming.
                       To simplify this process, I created a scripting tool that automates the search for files within my bulk emails,
                       compresses them into zip or rar files, and then automatically sends them to my colleagues via email.
                    </p>
